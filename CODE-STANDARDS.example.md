* Code standards, based on https://github.com/christopherliu/code-standards

# Style standards
* JSSTYLE: Use this style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), because we don't want to reinvent the wheel.
* HTMLCSSSTYLE: And this one (https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
* LINEWIDTH: Required line width of 120 characters, prefered line width of 80 characters (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/578059/studies-on-optimal-code-width)

# Library standards
* TAILWIND: Use TailwindCSS by default. When code becomes repetitive and standardization becomes necessary, use CSS Modules & components. Past code used MUI and CSS Modules.
